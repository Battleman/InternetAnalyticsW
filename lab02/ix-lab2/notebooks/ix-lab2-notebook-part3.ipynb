    "Our method achieves a pretty good score. We use the specific topology of the graph that has a lot of islands. Even if our average is higher, you can notice that pretty often, 45% of the population dies. This is because after cutting the graph, there remains one connected component that represents 45% of the graph alone. The chance of having the epidemy starting here is less than a half. Moreover, if the epidemic does not start there, we get really good results (surviving rate > 80%) as all our other connected components are quite small. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to compute the exepected percentage of infected + dead people at day 30, assuming we have a big component containing 45% of the population and that all other connected components contain on average 15% of the population.\n",
    "Let D be our random variable counting percentage of infected + dead people at day 30.\n",
    "E(D) = 0.45 * 45% + 0.55 * 15% = 28,5 %\n",
    "That gives us an expected survival rate of 71,5% percent, which is quite close to what we got experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal is to maximize the average, this strategy probably yields better result than cutting the graph in components of even size. This is probably due to the fact that for this graph, with this budget, an even partition gives you three components with aproximately the same size and so a survival rate of aproximately 1-1/3 = 66%."
