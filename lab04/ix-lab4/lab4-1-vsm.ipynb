To avoid long cells of codes in the notebook, you can also embed long python functions and classes in a separate module. Donâ€™t forget to hand in your module if that is the case. In multiple exercises, you are required to come up with your own method to solve various problems. Be creative and clearly motivate and explain your methods. Creativity and clarity will be considered for grading.*"

    "   * **Stopwords** : Obviously, terms as \"*the*\", \"*it*\" and such do not need to appear in our bag of words. They will only cause useless noise, as they appear a lot but in (almost) every description.\n",
    "   * **Taking numbers out** : this was a decision we made. A lot of numbers are useless (such as describing time) but some are far from useless (e.g. \"*3SAT*\"). Therefore, we decided to remove lone numbers or when separated by the character *h*. This already removes most of the noise.\n",
    "   * **Split appended** : Not quite a word-filtering function but still preprocesses. Due to the scraping method used, words ending and beginning a line (originally separated by a *\\n*) were stuck together. Our function separates these, based on the presence of an uppercase charactes in the middle of a word. Sentences starting with a lower case character (thus creating fused words with only lower cases) could not be split.\n",
    "   * **Punctuation** : \"*word*\", \"*word!*\" and \"*word.*\" should be treated equally ; furthermore, punctuation signs standing on their own (not appended to a word) will create a unique word, which should not be the case. Thus, we removed all punctuation sign (see complete list in the *helper* file)\n",
    "   * **Lower cased** : our system should not be case-sensitive, so once capital letters are not important anymore (as in splitting), we put all letters to lower case. \n",
